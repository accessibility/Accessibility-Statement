# Building an Accessibility Statement

## Site accessibility checklist

- do you have HTML5 headings?
- color contrast
- use of alt text

## Enhancements you might have missed

- WAI-ARIA
- Keyboard controls

## What we built this site with and why

- If you use Drupal or have selected a Accessibility Ready WordPress theme, state that
- We want users to know what you are using so that they can fix the problems they find in the right place

## If you run into difficulties

- Use this webform, send us an email or reach out to us on our social media
- This site will never be 100% accessibile, but working with you we will eliminate barriers to help us get closer
- Good here to highlight that you have an accessibility coordinator

## What are our goals

- We are seeking to be WCAG 2.0 AA compliant
- We have incorporated elements of ATAG 2.0 AA to see that we are able to both engage people with disabilities in creating content and assist authors in creating more accessible content.

## Assistive technology we test with

- Latest release plus one

## Make sure your alt text is properly structured

- review it to see that it is in plain language & without jargon - run it through http://www.hemingwayapp.com/
- Test to see that it is the most accessible page on your site
- Ensure this page is reviewed by a 3rd party
- Spellcheck this page and ensure that if it has web forms there is proper validation
