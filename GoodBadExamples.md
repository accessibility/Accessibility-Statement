# Some Example Language from Existing Accessibility Statements

## Good Examples

### Screen reader applications

We recommend several screen reader applications for customers with vision disabilities: JAWS, VoiceOver and NVDA. On mobile devices, we recommend TalkBack for Android devices and VoiceOver for the iPhone and iPad.

If you use Internet Explorer, use JAWS as your screen reader; if you use Firefox, then use NVDA as your screen reader.

We update our recommendations when new versions of major software and browser are released. We can’t guarantee the best user experience if you decide to use software and browser versions that we don’t specifically recommend.

You can improve your online experience by exploring these features and settings available in various assistive technology applications:

Special characters–If it’s required by your screen reading application, enable settings to automatically read any of these special characters: @, #, $, &, ', ", /, |, _, { }, [ ] and words with tilde or grave accented characters.

Symbols–If it’s required by your screen reading application, enable settings to automatically read these symbols: +, -, =, *, \, %, ^, ( ), < and >.
Browsers

We recommend using the most current version (or the version released just prior to) of Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or Chrome.

Use the browser controls to adjust the size and colors of content on a web page. We’ve designed our website content to work with these controls.

### If you use a screen reader

Not everyone navigates websites in the same way, so we’ve designed our sites to work with screen readers. We use text (in ALT tags) to describe images. We use descriptive links (e.g. More about mortgages instead of Click here) so you know where the link takes you, and we don’t use frames which are difficult for screen readers and special browsers to interpret.

### Website Accessibility

Most browsers have built-in accessibility features that Schwab.com supports, from the ability to change colors, contrast, and text size to using screen readers and skip controls.
