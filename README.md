# Accessibility Statement - Accessibility Information Page

Most accessibility statements suck.  They are boiler-plate documents which don't provide a useful snapshot about what an organization is doing to remove barriers to access. 

My hope is that by developing a template collectively we can define best practices. 

## An Accessibility Information Page should:
- State that inclusion is important for the organization
- Explain what has been done to make the site more accessible
- **Include information about other accessibility services**
- Make accessibility enhancements more discoverable
- Highlight the technology stack and if accessibility played into it's selection
- If you use automated testing tools, tell us which ones you use
- **Have an easy, accessibile way to contact the web admins if someone runs into a barrier (possibly including a phone number)**
- State the accessibility guidelines that the site is working to achieve
- **Provide details about the organizationâ€™s web accessibility policy**
- Indicate if there is an accessibility coordinator or committee
- Highlight goals for assistive technology supported (ie. latest release + one)
- **Be linked to from every page on the site in the footer or header**
- Something to verify that this is a journey and that this is being regularly updated

## Bonus points if:
- If an audit was done on the site, it would be beneficial to say who did it and when
- If it was tested with assistive technology, it would be useful to know what versions and when.
