# Accessibility statement example

## What we built this site with and why

- If you use Drupal or have selected a Accessibility Ready WordPress theme, state that
- We want users to know what you are using so that they can fix the problems they find in the right place

## If you run into difficulties

- Use this webform, send us an email or reach out to us on our social media
- This site will never be 100% accessibile, but working with you we will eliminate barriers to help us get closer

## What are our goals

- We are seeking to be WCAG 2.0 AA compliant
- We have incorporated elements of ATAG 2.0 AA to see that we are able to both engage people with disabilities in creating content and assist authors in creating more accessible content.

## Assistive technology we test with
